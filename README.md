# The Howl editor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/howl-editor/howl.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/howl-editor/howl)

## What is it?

Howl is a general purpose editor, that aims to be both light-weight
and fully customizable. It's built on top of the very fast
[LuaJIT](http://luajit.org) runtime, uses [Gtk](http://www.gtk.org) for it's
interface, and can be extended in either [Lua](http://www.lua.org) or
[Moonscript](http://www.moonscript.org). It's known to work on Linux, but
should work on at least the \*BSD:s as well.

It is released as free software under the [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
license, with the source being available on [Github](https://github.com/howl-editor/howl).

Visit [howl.io](http://howl.io) for installation instructions and documentation,
and follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/howleditor) for updates.

## Quick installation instructions

The home page contains more elaborate instruction, including pointers to
existing distribution packages, but below you'll find the basic instructions for
how to install Howl from source.

### Build requirements

- `wget`: For auto-downloading build dependencies.
- `GTK+`: Version >= 3, with development files (e.g. `libgtk-3-dev` on Debian
based system).
- `C compiler`: Howl has a very small C core itself, but it embedds
dependencies written in C.

### Build && install

Clone the repository or download and unpack a release. Cd into the `src`
directory, and issue `make && sudo make install`. The installed binary will be
named `howl`.

## License

Howl is released under the MIT license (see the LICENSE.md file for the full
details).
