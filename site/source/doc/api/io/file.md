# howl.io.File

## Overview

The File class provides an abstraction over a path in the file system, and
allows for querying the file for associated information as well as modifying it.

_See also_:

- The [spec](../../spec/io/file_spec.html) for File

## Class Properties

### separator

Holds the directory separator character.

## Properties

### basename

The basename of the file.

```lua
  File('/foo/base.ext').basename -- => 'base.ext'
```

### children

A list of children for the file, as File instances.

```moonscript
  children = howl.io.File('/bin/').children
  #children -- => 161
  basenames = [f.basename for f in *children]
  table.concat basenames, ', ', 1, 5 -- => "bunzip2, bzcat, bzcmp, bzdiff, bzegrep"
```

### contents

The contents of the file. Provides an easy way of reading a file's content in
one go. This is also writeable - assigning to this causes the file's content on
disk to be replaced with the assigned value.

### display_name

The basename of the file, but with a trailing separator for directories.

### etag

The "entity tag" for the file. Entity tags provides a way of determining whether
a file is changed on disk or not, and provides a more abstract alternative to
checking modified times, etc.

### exists

True if the file exists, and false otherwise.

### extension

The basename of the file name.

```lua
  File('/foo/base.ext').extension -- => 'ext'
  File('/foo/base').extension -- => nil
```

### file_type

The type of the file as a string. Possible values are:

- 'directory'
- 'regular'
- 'symlink'
- 'special'
- 'unknown'
- 'mountable'


### is_backup

True if the file is a backup file, and false otherwise.

### is_directory

True if the file's path denotes a directory, an false otherwise.

### is_hidden

True if the file is hidden, and false otherwise.

### is_link

True if the file's path denotes a symbolic link, an false otherwise.

### is_mountable

True if the file's path denotes a mountable location, and false otherwise.

### is_regular

True if the file's path denotes a regular file, and false otherwise.

### is_special

True if the file's path denotes a "special" file, such as a fifo, character
device, sockets, etc. False if not.

### modified_at

The UNIX time since the file was modified, as an unsigned 64-bit number.

```lua
  File('/bin/ls').modified_at -- => 1358406188ULL
```

### parent

The file's parent, if available, as another File instance.

```lua
  File('/foo/base.ext').parent.path -- => '/foo'
  File('/').parent -- => nil
```

### readable

True if the file is readable, and false otherwise.

### size

The size of the file, in bytes. Trying to read the size of a non-existing file
is raises an error.

### short_path

The file's path, shortened by replacing any references to the home directory
with `~`.

### writeable

True if the file is writeable, and false otherwise.

### uri

The file's path, as a URI.

```lua
  File('/foo/base.ext').uri -- => 'file:///foo/base.ext'
```

## Functions

### File(target, base_directory)

Creates a new File instance, pointing to `target`. `target` can either a string,
in which case it is considered a path, or another File instance. When target is
a string holding a relative path, `base_directory` is used for resolving the
relative path to an absolute path if given.

### copy (dest, flags)

Copies the contents of the current file to `dest`. Valid values for the `flags`
table include `COPY_OVERWRITE`, `COPY_BACKUP`, `COPY_NOFOLLOW_SYMLINKS`,
`COPY_ALL_METADATA`, `COPY_NO_FALLBACK_FOR_MOVE`, and
`COPY_TARGET_DEFAULT_PERMS`. (Their corresponding effects are documented
[here](https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GFile.html#GFileCopyFlags)).

### expand_path (path)

Replaces any ocurrences `~` with the full path to the home directory.

### is_absolute (path)

Returns true if `path` is an absolute path, and false otherwise.

### tmpdir()

Returns a File instance pointing to an existing temporary directory. The
directory will not be automatically deleted.

### tmpfile()

Returns a File instance pointing to an existing temporary file. The file will
not be automatically deleted.

### with_tmpfile (callback)

Invokes `callback` with a File instance pointing to an existing temporary file.
The temporary file will be automatically deleted upon the return of `callback`,
if it exists.

## Methods

### delete ()

Deletes the file. Raises an error if unsuccesful.

### delete_all ()

For a directory, delete the directory and all files contained within it. Raises
an error if unsuccesful.

### find (options = {})

For a directory, returns all files within the directory or any sub directory of
the directory. `options` allows for additional control of the operation, and can
contain the following fields:

- `filter`: A callback that will recieve each file as its sole argument. To
filter a file, i.e. exclude it from the results, the callback should return
true. The search is performed breadth first, so filtering a directory means that
it won't be descended into at all.

- `sort`: Causes the entries of all directories to be sorted before processing.

### is_below (directory)

Returns true if the file is located below `directory`, and false otherwise.

### join (...)

Joins the file with any path components passed in as parameters, and returns a
new File pointing to the resulting path.

### mkdir ()

Creates a new directory at the path denoted by the file. Raises an error if
unsuccesful.

### mkdir_p ()

Creates a new directory at the path denoted by the file, including any
non-existing intermediate directories. Raises an error if unsuccesful.

### open (mode = 'r', callback = nil)

Opens the file in the mode specified by `mode`, and returns the Lua file
descriptor. Any error when opening the file causes an error to be raised.

When `callback` is specified it is invoked with the file descriptor, and any
return values from the callback are used as the return values for `open`. The
file description will in this case always be closed prior to `open` returning.

### read (...)

A quick way of issuing a Lua
[read](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-file:read) call for the
file. This will open the file for reading, issue the read call, and close the
file before returning the resulting values.

### relative_to_parent (parent)

Returns the path for the current file relative to its parent.

```lua
File('/bin/ls'):relative_to_parent(File('/bin')) -- => 'ls'
```

### rm ()

Alias for [delete](#delete).

### rm_r ()

Alias for [delete_all](#delete_all).

### touch ()

Ensures that the file exists, by creating it if not already present.

### unlink ()

Alias for [delete](#delete).

## Meta methods

In addition to the above properties and methods, File instances also responds to
certain meta methods.

### Joining files

Apart from using the [join](#join) method, File instances can also be joined by
using the `/` operator or the `..` operator:

```lua
(File('/bin') / 'ls').path -- => '/bin/ls'
(File('/bin') .. 'ls').path -- => '/bin/ls'
```

Concatenating a File instance to a string returns a string though:

```lua
"File is " .. File('/bin') -- => 'File is /bin'
```

### Files as strings

Files respond to the tostring meta method:

```lua
tostring(File('/bin/ls')) -- => '/bin/ls'
```

### Comparing files

Files can be lexically compared to other File instances.

```lua
File('/bin/ls') == File('/bin/ls') -- => true
File('/bin/ls') == File('/bin/cat') -- => false
File('/bin/ls') < File('/bin/cat') -- => false
File('/bin/ls') > File('/bin/cat') -- => true
```
