title: What's next?
---

As noted at the top of the documentation index, the documentation is not
complete. This means that there's a lot more interesting stuff about Howl that
has yet to documented, both for the API documentation and the manual. This
includes things such as Howl's bundle system and how you can write your own
bundles, how to add support for a new language, how to create a new theme, etc.
Unfortunately there are only so many hours in a day.

Meanwhile, if this looks interesting to you, then dive in! Don't be afraid of
browsing through the source to see what's there. If you're wondering about how
something works, have a look to see if there's any [spec](../#howl-specs) that
covers it. And you can always [get in contact](/contact.html).
