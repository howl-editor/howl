      %p
        Howl is a general purpose editor that aims to be both lightweight and fully
        customizable. It is built on top of the very fast
        #{link_to "LuaJIT", "http://luajit.org"} runtime, and can be extended in either
        #{link_to "Lua", "http://www.lua.org"} or #{link_to "Moonscript", "http://www.moonscript.org"}.
        It has a minimalistic UI driven mainly by the keyboard.
