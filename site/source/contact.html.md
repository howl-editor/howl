## Contact

Any feedback, be it patches, feature request or bug reports is most welcome.

If you want to provide patches, the preferred way of doing so would be as a pull
request via GitHub, or as a pull request from some other Git server. Should that
not be an option patches can be sent over email as well.

### Bug reports and feature requests

If you have any bug reports or feature requests, you can submit these to the
[Github issue tracker](https://github.com/howl-editor/howl/issues). There's also
a subreddit for Howl, so if you're on Reddit don't hesitate to post there with
questions or general announcements:
[r/howleditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/howleditor).


### Chat

You can also drop in chat over at the [Gitter](https://gitter.im) chatroom
available for Howl: [https://gitter.im/howl-editor/howl](https://gitter.im/howl-editor/howl).

### Email
