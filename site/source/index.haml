    %p
      Howl is a general purpose, text oriented, editor, that aims to be both light-weight
      and fully customizable. It's built on top of the very fast
      #{link_to "LuaJIT", "http://luajit.org"} runtime, and can be extended in either
      #{link_to "Lua", "http://www.lua.org"} or #{link_to "Moonscript", "http://www.moonscript.org"}.

      It is released as free software under the #{link_to "MIT", "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"}
      license, with the source being available on #{link_to "Github", "https://github.com/howl-editor/howl"}.

    %p
      Howl has few build dependencies, and should not take to long to install.
      It is being developed on Linux, but it should build on other *NIX platforms
      as well such as the *BSD family, although your mileage may vary. Have a
      look at the installation instructions to get started.

      Start off with the
      #{link_to "Getting started", "doc/manual/getting-started.html"} section
      from the user manual, which should hopefully get you off the ground.
      For more information about the API and what you can do with Howl,
      head over to the #{link_to "Documentation index", "doc/"}.
