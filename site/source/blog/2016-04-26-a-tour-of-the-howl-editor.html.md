title: A tour of the Howl editor
location: Florida, USA

[Ryan](https://github.com/kirbyfan64) sat down a while ago and made an
introductory video for Howl, where he amongst other things gives an overview of
basic key bindings, configuration and talks about the various ways Howl can be
extended.

If you're new to Howl this provides a nice introduction to various aspects of
the Howl editor, and if you're already a user you get the chance to see a fellow
user's perspective on Howl and perhaps pick up a few tricks along the way.
