## Contact

Any feedback, be it patches, feature request or bug reports is most welcome.

If you want to provide patches, the preferred way of doing so would be as a pull
request via GitHub, or as a pull request from some other Git server. Should that
not be an option patches can be sent over email as well.

If you have any bug reports or feature requests, please submit these to the
[Github issue tracker](https://github.com/howl-editor/howl/issues). As with
patches, you can send these via email as well.

Get in contact via email: \<nino at nordman.org\>.
