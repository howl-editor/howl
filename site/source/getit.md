# Installing Howl

Howl is developed on Linux, but it builds on other \*NIX platforms as well such
as FreeBSD and OpenBSD (with other \*BSDs presumably requiring only little work), along with
Windows. It should be possible to port to OSX, should any brave soul be willing to
put in the work.

You can install Howl by building it from source, either from a release or by
cloning the repository from Github.

## Latest release

The latest release of Howl is 0.5.3. It was released at 2017-11-07, and is
available for download from:

## Building or installing Howl on Windows

See [the Windows-specific documentation](/getit.windows.html).

## Building Howl from source

### Build requirements

Howl requires the following build dependencies:

- `wget`: For auto-downloading build dependencies (only needed when building
from a code checkout, as the release tarball contains pre-downloaded
dependencies).

- `GTK+`: Version >= 3, with development files.

  For example:

  * On Debian-based based systems you would need the `libgtk-3-dev` package.
  * For Fedora you would need the `gtk3-devel` package.

- `C compiler`: Howl has a very small C core itself, and it embedds a few
dependencies built in C.

### Building

Download and unpack a Howl release, or get the source from
[Github](https://github.com/howl-editor/howl), either by cloning the repository
or by download a Zip-file of the desired branch/tag.. Compile Howl by issuing
`make` from the `src` directory (`gmake` for \*BSD). When building directly from
a source checkout, in-app dependencies will automatically be downloaded for you
using `wget`. Once it's built, you can if you want run it directly as is from
the `src` directory, like so: `$ ./howl`. To install it properly however, so
that it integrates into your desktop, you'll want to run the `make install`
command.

*Example session:*

```
[nilnor@cohen:~/tmp]% git clone https://github.com/howl-editor/howl.git
Cloning into 'howl'...
remote: Counting objects: 7924, done.
[..]
Checking connectivity... done
[nilnor@cohen:~/tmp]%
[nilnor@cohen:~/tmp]% cd howl/src/
[nilnor@cohen:~/tmp/howl/src]% make -j 4
[snipped download and compiling]
make  49.44s user 4.21s system 81% cpu 1:05.74 total
[nilnor@cohen:~/tmp/howl/src]% sudo make install
[sudo] password for nilnor:
Installing to /usr/local..
All done.
```

Howl installs to `/usr/local` by default, but you can specify a different location to install to
by specifying `PREFIX` to make, like so:

```shell
make PREFIX=~/.local
make PREFIX=~/.local install
```

*NB: If you install to a non-standard location, your desktop environment might
not pick up on the fact that Howl is installed, and the application icon will
look ugly as the result.*

### Tracking the latest from Github

We developers use Howl every day for our daily development, and we try our best
to keep the master branch stable and suitable for production usage at all times.
If you want to follow along with the latest updates for Howl, simply clone the
repository from Github and build as per the above instructions. To update just
pull the latest additions, and issue make again from the src directory. _Don't
forget to make again though_, as this would cause stale byte code to be loaded
and confusion to arise.
