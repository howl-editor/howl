# Changelog

## Unreleased (in master)

- Added a new command, `project-build` that executes a pre-configured command
from the projects root directory (using the command configured in the new
`project_build_command` variable).

- New Nim bundle (lexing, structure, etc)

- New Python bundle (lexing, structure, etc). Replaces the old basic Python
mode.

- Lexer fixes: Ruby, C/C++, HTML, HAML

- Lisp and sub modes: Better indentation support

- Added previews for the `switch-buffer` and `project-open` commands.

- HTML mode: Sub lex inline styling

- Upgrade to LuaJIT 2.0.4

- Upgrade to Moonscript 0.3.1

- Replaced the readline and input system with a new command line and
interactions system resulting in new API.

- Updated the `buffer-replace` command and added a new `buffer-replace-regex`
command. Both show live previews of replacements and allow selective exclusion.

- Command history is now recorded and can be viewed by using the `up` key from
the command line. Previously run commands can be re-run by selecting them from
the history.

- New PHP bundle, featuring a new PHP mode with advanced syntax highlighting.

- The `describe-key` command now shows the commands bound to the key press.

- Added indirect bindings support to keymaps using the `binding_for` field.

- Added a new comprehensive API for launching and controlling external processes
(howl.io.Process).

- Added two new commands for launching external processes: `exec` and
`project-exec`. The former opens up a prompt for launching an external process
from the directory of the current file (if available), whereas the latter
launches an external process from the base directory of the current project.
Both opens up a new process buffer for displaying any process output (ANSI color
sequences supported).

- Substituted certain key names to avoid ambiguity, e.g. `alt_l` now gets
substituted for `altL` so that pressing left alt is distinguishable from
pressing alt + l (issue #29)

- VI:
  * Refuse to enter INSERT mode for a read-only buffer
  * Bind `?` to `buffer-search-backward`

- Added new method, `Buffer.save_as(file)`, for associating with and saving a
buffer's content to a specified file.

- Added new function, `bindings.binding_for`, for finding a binding for a
particular action.

- Added a new StyledText (howl.ui.StyledText) class in the API, used for holding
a chunk of text along with corresponding styles. ActionBuffer now supports
inserting or appending such instances. Along with this a new simple markup
parser was added (Howl Markup, howl.ui.markup.howl) that can be used to easily
create StyledText instances.

- Added a new command `buffer-search-backward` that implements an interactive
search for the text typed by the user, backwards from the cursor position. Bound
this command to `ctrl_r`.

- Enabled jumping to the next or previous match while an interactive search is
running. The bindings for `buffer-search-backward` or `buffer-search-forward`
(`ctrl_r` and `ctrl_f` by default) are used for this while either command is
active.

- Added two new commands `buffer-search-word-backward` and
`buffer-search-word-forward` that do an exact word match, using the configured
word pattern, for the current word at cursor. Bound these commands to
`ctrl_comma` and `ctrl_period`.

- Updated interactive `buffer-search-backward` and `buffer-search-forward`
commands to highlight all matches on screen in addition to the primary match.
Added a new highlight style called `search_secondary` for the non primary
matches.

- Ruby: Update lexer to properly lex bare general delimited strings, e.g.
`my_string = %{string here}`.

### Bugs fixed

- A slew of issues as seen on [Github](https://github.com/howl-editor/howl/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=created%3A%3E2015-05-09+created%3A%3C2015-09-02+state%3Aclosed++type%3Aissue)

- Fix highlighting of "bad braces", i.e. braches for which no match could be
found.

### API changes

- The old readline API was significantly revamped for this release, with changes
too numerous to list here. The documentation for the new
[readline](http://howl.io/doc/api/interact.html) module is a good starting point
for seeing how the new API looks.

- `Buffer.file`: Assigning a new file causes the buffer contents to always be
reloaded, regardless of the modification status. If the file does not exist, the
buffer's contents will be emptied.

- `Buffer.reload()`: `reload` now takes an additional parameter, `force`, that
allows reloading a buffer even if the buffer is currently modified.

- `Buffer.find()`, `Buffer.rfind()`: new methods that implement forward and
reverse search on the entire buffer text, or starting at `init` argument if
provided. These methods work with character offsets.

- `ustring.urfind()`, `ustring.rfind()`: new methods that implement reverse
search for a given string within the string. The `urfind` method uses character
offsets while `rfind` uses byte offsets.

### Deprecations removed

Command names deprecated in the 0.2 release have now been removed.

## 0.2.1 (2014-05-09)

- Added a new command `editor-cycle-case` that changes the case of the current
word or selection. The new case is automatically chosen based on the current
case. The command cycles through lowercase -> uppercase -> titlecase.

- Prompt before saving a buffer if the file on disk was modified (issue #25)

### Bugs fixed

- Moonscript: Fix incorrect lexing of `nil`, `true`, and `false` when they are
prefixes of an identifier.

- Haml: Properly lex attribute lists after class and id declarations

- `editor-paste` now cuts any existing selection before pasting (issue #26)

- Cairo error introduced with patch for flickering on Gtk 3 in 0.2, that was
seen on Gtk 3.4.2 (issue #28)

- Sporadic and rare LuaJIT "bad callback" panic should be fixed.

## 0.2 (2014-04-30)

- Avoid having the readline grow and shrink as much, which is annoying since it
requires the eyes to move up and down. Now the readline will only grow during
one read() invocation, and will keep the same fixed size regardless of the
amount of items in the completion list.

- Added howl.clipboard, new module for handling multiple clipboard items. A new
command, `editor-paste..`, was added as well that allows for pasting a selected
clip from the clipboard.

- Added a new configuration variable, `line_padding`, which allows for setting
extra padding for lines (issue #14)

- Removed fuzzy matching. It was noisy, and added little value.

- Added case boundary matching (e.g. 'cc' now match against 'CreditCard' and
'camelCase').

- Improved buffer-grep and buffer-structure commands:
  * They are now about an order of magnitude faster for large files (issue #7)
  * They now provide live previews by automatically showing the currently
selected line in the buffer with the search highlighting (issue #15)

- `open` command: Completing a directory with `/` now changes directory
automatically (issue #5).

- Better structure view for Python mode (issue #12)

- Scrolling is now remembered for buffers, in addition to the position that was
previously remembered.

- Command key bindings can contain partial text, enabling bindings such as `open
/bin`, which for the example would open the readline with the open command
displaying the contents of `/bin`.

- Added a new config variable, `completion_skip_auto_within`, which allows for
specifying a list of styles for which the completion list should not
automatically pop up.

- `save-as` command now prompts before overwriting an existing file.

- References to home directory are now shortened to '~' in the file prompt.

- HAML: Filters are sub lexed where possible (e.g. JavaScript)

- Added proper CoffeeScript support

Includes extensive lexing, indentation and structure support. Also supports
literate CoffeeScript.

- Improve code block completions when the start and end delimiters are the same

E.g. `///` for CoffeeScript, or fenced code blocks for Markdown.

### VI bundle

- Fix pasting of line block yanks (i.e. <y><y>/<Y>/<d><d>)
- Fix count handling for yank
- Fix <y><y> to yank current line correctly
- Support '<' and '>' in visual mode
- New bindings: 'H', 'L', 'M'
- Pulled in upstream Scintilla patch for bug where the cursor could end up
invisible when switching from insert to command

### Bugs fixed

- Completion popup now closes upon entering a non-character (issue #9)

- Brace matching of braces before the cursor are now highlighted correctly
(issue #16)

- Buffer grep fixed for buffers with empty lines

- Byte code compilation no longers requires a $DISPLAY

- Overly long lines in the readline caused horizontal scrolling (issue #8)

- `buffer-replace` command failed to handle empty replacement strings

- Boundary matching was not working correctly in all cases

- Pasting in the readline did not update completions (issue #6)

- Lib directory not found when binary was invoked without path (issue #17)

- Readline keeps focus, avoids weird state e.g. when clicking in an editor while
in the readline (issue #23).

- Ruby: Avoid over-eager lexing of regexes

- HTML mode: Don't lex strings within HTML content

- Flickering for Gtk+-3 versions 3.9.2 or greater was alleviated. It's still
pending a fully satisfactory fix however.

### Command name changes

In order to streamline the naming of commands, the below commands have been
renamed:

* toggle-fullscreen -> window-toggle-fullscreen
* toggle-maximized -> window-toggle-maximized

* reflow-paragraph -> editor-reflow-paragraph

* search-forward -> buffer-search-forward
* repeat-search -> buffer-repeat-search
* replace -> buffer-replace
* replace-pattern -> buffer-replace-pattern
* reload-buffer -> buffer-reload
* force-mode -> buffer-mode

* mode-set -> set-for-mode
* buffer-set -> set-for-buffer

* new-view-above -> view-new-above
* new-view-below -> view-new-below
* new-view-left-of -> view-new-left-of
* new-view-right-of -> view-new-right-of

In addition, the following alias has been deprecated:

* fill-paragraph (alias for editor-reflow-paragraph)

The old command names are still present and working, but are deprecated and will
be removed in a future release.

### API changes

- howl.fs.File is now at howl.io.File

The old path is deprecated and will be removed in future releases, but still
works as of now.

## 0.1.1 (2014-03-15)

- Fix incompatibility with older Gtk versions.

## 0.1 (2014-03-15)

First public release.
