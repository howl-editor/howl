 <summary>Lightweight editor with keyboard-centric minimalistic interface</summary>
 <description>
  <p>
   Howl is a general purpose editor that aims to be both lightweight
   and fully customizable. It is built on top of the very fast LuaJIT
   runtime, and can be extended in either Lua or Moonscript. It has a
   minimalistic UI driven mainly by the keyboard.
